Welcome to slackware-musl linux!

This is my attempt to create a distro based on 
the simplicity of slackware. The distro is based 
on not only slackware, but also borrows build scripts
from other distros like sabotage-linux, alpine linux
and the (now defunct?) sta.li linux, all but the 
first one being based on the musl libc library.

(I haven't seen sta.li's build files for a while now,
so no pun intended. It disappeared just as mysteriously
as it appeared into the world.) 

You can contact us on irc.freenode.net, channel #smlinux.

To get started, read the README in the COMPILER directory.
Happy slacking!
