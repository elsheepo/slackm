### :rocket: Mission

This is my attempt to create a distro based on
the simplicity of [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) that leverages the lightweight, fast, simple, free, and correct C Standard library, [musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/). smLinux is based
on not only Slackware, but also borrows build scripts
from other distros like sabotage-linux, alpine linux
and the (now defunct?) sta.li linux, all but the
first one being based on the musl libc library.

(I haven't seen sta.li's build files for a while now,
so no pun intended. It disappeared just as mysteriously
as it appeared into the world.)
