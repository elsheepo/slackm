**** CONSOLE KEYMAPPINGS ****

You can change the keyboard mappings by running the "loadkmap"
applet provided by busybox. To view the available mappings,
run "loadkeys" program, or you can simply find the mappings by
doing ls /usr/share/kmap.

loadkmap < /usr/share/kmap/us.kmap

^ Loads US keyboard mappings.

And then add it to /etc/rc.d/rc.local or any other convenient place

**** CONSOLE FONTS ****

Console fonts can be loaded using the setfont applet provided by busybox.
However, busybox won't load psf.gz/pcf.gz files. It'll only load .psf files:

setfont /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ter-v*.psf
